//! Bootstrap-wire re-dial: keep the secondary→submitter link restorable
//! after the `-R` tunnel drops.
//!
//! # The defect this fixes (defect (b))
//!
//! The secondary dials the submitter primary's bootstrap wire ONCE at
//! startup over the per-secondary `ssh -R` reverse tunnel
//! (`connect_wss_only(localhost:<tunnel_port>)`), then folds that wire
//! into the mesh via [`PeerNetwork::register_primary_link`]. The dialed
//! address was DISCARDED, and the inbound forwarder exited SILENTLY when
//! the wire closed — so when the `-R` tunnel dropped and the observer
//! later rebuilt it, NOBODY re-dialed QUIC/WSS through the fresh tunnel.
//! The submitter→observer stayed blind forever. The submitter's transport
//! is inbound-only (no dial path), and the secondary's generic peer
//! reconnect ticker only redials peers in `peer_dial_info` — which the
//! bootstrap wire was never entered into. This module restores ONLY the
//! re-dial of the bootstrap pipe.
//!
//! # Why a SEPARATE loop, not the generic `peer_dial_info` ticker
//!
//! Routing the bootstrap wire through the generic
//! [`PeerNetwork::process_reconnect_tick`] / `spawn_dial_task` path was
//! rejected for two hard reasons, both load-bearing:
//!
//! 1. **Honest-liveness invariant (mod.rs `register_primary_link` doc).**
//!    The generic outgoing handler wires the connection's reader/writer
//!    exit into the QUIC `disconnect_tx` channel, which feeds the
//!    mesh prune+redial disposition. The bootstrap-primary entry
//!    DELIBERATELY does NOT feed that channel — the secondary→primary
//!    link's app-layer liveness (the `should_arm_failover` failure
//!    window, keyed on `DistributedMessage` arrival) is the SOLE failover
//!    signal, decoupled from QUIC packet liveness by design. A redial that
//!    introduced a QUIC-liveness edge into failover arming would violate
//!    that invariant. This module's redial restores the TRANSPORT PIPE
//!    ONLY: it emits no event any failover input consumes — it dials,
//!    re-folds, done. `should_arm_failover` / mesh-degraded / election
//!    inputs are untouched.
//!
//! 2. **Re-fold semantics.** A restored bootstrap wire must re-enter the
//!    mesh via [`PeerNetwork::register_primary_link`] (fan-in `mesh_writer`
//!    plus inbound forwarder into the single `incoming_tx`), NOT the
//!    generic `spawn_outgoing_handler` + `new_conn_tx` registration. And
//!    the dial is `connect_wss_only` against the FIXED
//!    `localhost:<tunnel_port>` tunnel address — never a
//!    `PeerConnectionInfo`-advertised LAN addr (the submitter is
//!    unroutable except through the tunnel).
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! [`BootstrapDialTarget`] carries the fixed dial address + the primary's
//! peer id. When a folded wire's inbound forwarder observes close, it
//! spawns [`redial_bootstrap_wire`], which dials with capped backoff
//! INDEFINITELY (the tunnel may be down for minutes; the observer link is
//! restorable at any time, so there is no give-up). On success it sends
//! the fresh [`crate::NetworkClient`] back to `recv_peer` through the
//! [`BootstrapRedial`] channel, where `&mut self` re-folds it via
//! `register_primary_link` — which arms the next forwarder, so the cycle
//! self-perpetuates for the life of the run.
