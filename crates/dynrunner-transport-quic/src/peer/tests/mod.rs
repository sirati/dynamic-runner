//! Tests for the QUIC peer overlay.
//!
//! Layout:
//! - [`bind_port`]: `PeerNetwork::start` bind-port contract (#355) —
//!   an explicit port pins both listeners (QUIC/UDP + WSS/TCP);
//!   `None` keeps the OS-picked ephemeral behaviour.
//! - [`cert_parsing`]: pure PEM→DER bridge tests (the `Err` strings
//!   are the no-valid-cert WARN's `reasons=` payload).
//! - [`dial_cert`]: dial-side cert contract — a cert-carrying seed
//!   entry connects QUIC; a cert-less one falls back to WSS with a
//!   NON-EMPTY `reasons=` on the no-valid-cert WARN.
//! - [`two_peers`]: basic peer exchange + dial tie-break
//!   (`higher_id_does_not_dial_lower_id`).
//! - [`recv_lifetime`]: `recv_peer_tick_survives_outer_drop` —
//!   future-drop hardening for the reconnect tick arm.
//! - [`reader_exit_disconnect`]: reader/writer-exit is the
//!   authoritative disconnect detector + the `same_channel`
//!   generation check that keeps a stale signal from pruning a
//!   freshly-reconnected entry.
//! - [`dial_failure_summary`]: the operator-visible per-peer
//!   dial-failure summary emitted from `process_reconnect_tick` —
//!   carries the dialed address + consecutive-failure count, throttled
//!   to the summary threshold/recurrence boundaries.
//! - [`broadcast_miss`]: broadcast honesty (#363) — a known
//!   (`peer_dial_info`) but unconnected peer that misses a broadcast
//!   is named by a WARN, once per peer per outage.
//! - [`dial_sweep`]: the `connect_to_peers` sweep-summary dispositions
//!   (#362) — spawned / already-connected / awaiting-inbound (lower-id
//!   rule) / dropped-from-list — plus the higher-id side's truthful
//!   "peer leg missing, this node never dials it" summary WARN.
//! - [`formation_retry`]: mesh-formation retry — a leg whose INITIAL
//!   dial never landed (peer unreachable during a startup-load window)
//!   stays tracked by the reconnect reconciliation and establishes the
//!   moment the peer becomes reachable, with no further membership
//!   event (run_20260611_200548 replay, transport half).
//! - [`ingest_edges`]: ingest-edge clock recording over a real wire —
//!   the read loop stamps ARRIVAL without anyone driving `recv_peer`
//!   (the starved-pump honesty), DRAINED only on the actual pull.
//! - [`late_joiner_forward`]: desktop-shaped late-joiner bootstrap —
//!   the RED repro (compute-internal address unreachable from this
//!   host ⇒ loud bounded `NoReachablePeer`), the GREEN contract
//!   (join + snapshot RPC succeed through a local TCP forward
//!   endpoint with a cert-less, WSS-only rewritten seed entry), and
//!   the production frame shape (the bootstrap window accepts a
//!   snapshot reply stamped with the Phase-C role-typed routing
//!   target, amid stamped broadcast gossip).
//! - [`log_capture`]: shared tracing capture layer + `pump_b_until`
//!   used by the silent-reconnect + dial-failure-summary scenarios;
//!   kept here because they observe the framework log trace.
//! - [`silent_reconnect`]: the canonical 3-peer partition→heal
//!   scenario (~450 lines, intentionally one file: the multi-phase
//!   setup/partition/drain/heal pump cannot be cleanly chopped
//!   without scattering the test's invariants).
//! - [`persistent_dial_failure_trigger`]: the per-leg forward-recovery
//!   trigger (#419) — a dial-owned peer that keeps failing past the
//!   dial-summary boundary publishes its id on the
//!   `notify_persistent_dial_failures` sink (throttled to the summary
//!   cadence); silent for connected and non-dial-owned peers.
//! - [`member_leg_redial`]: the half-open member↔member leg heal
//!   (run_20260610_221140 / BUG 3.3) — the non-dial-owner's
//!   `RedialRequest` nudges the dial owner to force-prune + re-dial,
//!   relay covers directed sends meanwhile; plus the
//!   genuine-departure stop (roster replacement forgets tracking).
//! - [`accept_replace_rejoin`]: the rejoin-exile heal (#416 /
//!   run_20260611_123632) — a removed-but-alive peer that redials is
//!   re-admitted because a fresh authenticated inbound REPLACES the
//!   stale half-open `connections` entry on the accept side; the
//!   lower-id-dials dedup is preserved on the dial-owner side, and the
//!   replacement is generation-checked.
//! - [`reset_then_redial`]: the simultaneous-reset replay
//!   (run_20260611_202345) — an established session RST plus aborted
//!   in-flight handshakes at BOTH listeners must not end the accept
//!   loops; the peer's re-dialed session re-registers and its replayed
//!   seq-stamped report is delivered + ackable, and the errored accept
//!   path neither spins nor monopolises the executor.
//!
//! The shared [`TestId`] is defined here so every sub-module gets
//! the same `Identifier` impl via `super::TestId`.
