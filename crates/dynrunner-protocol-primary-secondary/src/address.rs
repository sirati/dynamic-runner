//! Typed addressing primitives for the primary/secondary protocol.
//!
//! # Concern
//!
//! This module owns the *addressing vocabulary* — the pure-data
//! [`Destination`] enum that describes **who** a message is for,
//! decoupled from **how** the transport gets it there, plus the
//! egress-edge [`resolve_destination`] that turns a [`Destination`]
//! into a concrete [`SendTarget`] the `PeerId`-only transport can act
//! on. The transport itself never resolves a role; resolution is the
//! coordinator edge's job (transport ⊥ roles).
//!
//! [`RoleTable`] and [`RoleChangeHookRegistrar`] live here too because
//! they are the *replicated role-state* shape — they describe **who
//! holds which role** in a form the manager edge can read to resolve
//! [`Destination::Primary`] without depending on the
//! manager-distributed crate (which owns the actual replication
//! mechanics via `ClusterState`). The registrar trait is the boundary
//! `ClusterState` implements. No transport subscribes to it: the edge
//! reads the table to resolve, the transport sees only a [`PeerId`].

/// Opaque peer identifier — the host peer-id of a node in the mesh.
///
/// A newtype over the peer-id string representation (the same `String`
/// carried by [`Destination::Secondary`] / [`Destination::Observer`]
/// and [`RoleTable::primary`]). It exists so the typed [`Destination`]
/// vocabulary never traffics in bare `String`s: a peer-id is a distinct
/// domain value, not "any string", and the type system should say so.
///
/// # Why a newtype rather than `String`
///
/// The mesh addresses hosts by id, and several distinct string-shaped
/// concepts coexist in this protocol (peer ids, role names, message
/// types). A newtype makes "this is a peer-id" unambiguous at every API
/// boundary and lets a misuse (passing, say, a role name where a host id
/// is expected) fail to compile rather than mis-route at runtime.
///
/// # Contract
///
/// - Cheap to clone (`String` inside); usable directly as a `HashMap`
///   key (`Hash + Eq`), which the mesh connection/keepalive tables need.
/// - `Display` / [`PeerId::as_str`] / `AsRef<str>` expose the underlying
///   id for logging and for transports that still key tables by `&str`.
/// - `From<String>` / `From<&str>` make migrating a call site that holds
///   a raw id a zero-friction wrap.
/// - **Serde transparent**: the wire/JSON form is exactly the inner
///   string, so a `PeerId` is interchangeable on the wire with the bare
///   id strings the protocol carries today — no envelope churn when call
///   sites migrate from `String` to `PeerId`.

///
/// - [`Destination::Primary`] resolves via `current_primary()` / the
///   role table to the **host peer-id** the primary runs on, and the
///   `Router` routes to that host. The primary is *this variant* — there
///   is no `"primary"` string literal; the literal id is never spoken.
/// - [`Destination::Secondary`] / [`Destination::Observer`] carry the
///   target **host peer-id** AND, on a multi-role host (one peer running
///   several coordinators), select **which receiving coordinator** the
///   frame is demuxed to by its role — replacing the ad-hoc
///   primary-facing check. The id selects the host; the variant selects
///   the role at that host.
/// - [`Destination::All`] is the cluster broadcast — fan out to every
///   peer (subsuming the legacy mesh / all-secondaries scopes).
/// - **Loopback is implicit**: when a resolved host id equals the local
///   peer-id, the transport delivers locally rather than over the wire.
///   Call sites never special-case "is this me?" — they address by
///   destination and the resolver short-circuits.
