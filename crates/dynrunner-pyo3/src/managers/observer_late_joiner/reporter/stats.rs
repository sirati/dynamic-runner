//! CRDT-derived statistics snapshot.
//!
//! # Single concern
//!
//! Read a `&ClusterState<I>` once and project it into the flat
//! [`StatsSnapshot`] the reporter formats + diffs. Everything here is a
//! pure function of the replicated ledger: there is no authority, no
//! pool, and no wall-clock — exactly the inputs a zero-authority
//! observer holds.
//!
//! # Why recompute here (not read pool accessors)
//!
//! An observer holds NO `PendingPool` — it carries only the replicated
//! `ClusterState`. So "waiting-on-deps" and "ready-in-queue", which on
//! the primary are pool-state reads, are RECOMPUTED here from the CRDT:
//! the `Pending` task set, each task's `task_depends_on`, and the
//! static phase-dependency graph (`phase_deps`). The recomputation
//! mirrors the pool's own resolution rule (a dep is satisfied once its
//! prereq is terminal; a phase is dispatchable once every phase it
//! depends on has fully terminated) so the two views converge.
