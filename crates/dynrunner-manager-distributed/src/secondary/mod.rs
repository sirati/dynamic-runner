//! `SecondaryCoordinator` — the state-machine that joins the
//! distributed manager mesh as a non-primary participant.
//!
//! # Sub-module layout
//!
//! - [`types`] — public boundary types: `RunOutcome` (per-run control
//!   signal), `SecondaryTerminal` (per-secondary terminal projection),
//!   `SecondaryConfig`, `PeerCertInfo`.
//! - [`coordinator`] — inherent-impl methods on
//!   `SecondaryCoordinator` (constructor, listener registration,
//!   observer-announcer attachment, mode flags, the `run` entry
//!   points).
//! - operational state-machine: [`dispatch`], [`election`],
//!   [`peer`], [`processing`], [`resource`], [`primary`],
//!   [`primary_link`], [`retry_budget`], [`setup`], [`staging`],
//!   [`wire`]. Each owns one concern of the running coordinator.
//!
//! This file holds the `SecondaryCoordinator` struct definition
//! itself plus its two internal support types (`PrimaryInFlightItem`,
//! `FailedTaskEntry`). The struct is the central type of the module
//! — its fields span the full state surface of one secondary in
//! flight — and a per-field split would force every operational
//! handler to thread the relevant subset through method arguments.
