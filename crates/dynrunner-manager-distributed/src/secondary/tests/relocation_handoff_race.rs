//! Production replay: the bootstrap relocation `PrimaryChanged` broadcast
//! is LOST on the wire while every secondary is still mid-setup
//! (asm-tokenizer run_20260610_185621 — the leaderless 8+ min wedge).
//!
//! The submitter's relocate (`relocate_primary_to`) is a ONE-SHOT
//! broadcast: when it races a transport outage (the production trace shows
//! the secondaries' bootstrap wires flapping — `bootstrap_redial` kept
//! re-folding the link minutes later) the announcement is gone and NOTHING
//! retransmits it. The relocated submitter (now the standalone observer)
//! keeps broadcasting its anti-entropy `StateDigest` every ~20s — the
//! digest carries `primary_epoch` + `current_primary`, so a pull-and-
//! restore would heal the missed announcement — but a secondary wedged in
//! `wait_for_setup` used to drop `StateDigest` / `ClusterSnapshot` frames
//! in the silent `other =>` arm, so the heal was structurally unreachable
//! pre-`Operational`: nobody ever promoted and the fleet idled forever.
//!
//! These tests replay that exact sequence over the channel mesh + the
//! production pump:
//!
//! - [`lost_relocation_announcement_heals_via_setup_anti_entropy`]: the
//!   CHOSEN secondary (the relocation target) misses the announcement,
//!   then receives the observer's digest. It must pull the snapshot,
//!   restore the primary fact naming ITSELF, and fire the
//!   `PromotionSignal` — from `Configuring`, without ever completing the
//!   setup trio (the setup peer never sends one).
//! - [`lost_relocation_announcement_non_chosen_follows_new_primary`]: a
//!   NON-chosen secondary heals the same way and converges its mirror on
//!   the new primary (the `bootstrap_redial` re-fold check: the
//!   placeholder must not stay the resolved primary), WITHOUT firing any
//!   promotion — and a later run-terminal digest round still tears it
//!   down cleanly through the loop-head terminal check.
//!
//! REVERT-CHECK: pre-fix both tests time out — the digest frames land in
//! `wait_for_setup`'s drop arm, no `RequestClusterSnapshot` is ever sent,
//! no promotion fires, and the secondary sits in the trio-wait exactly
//! like the production fleet.
