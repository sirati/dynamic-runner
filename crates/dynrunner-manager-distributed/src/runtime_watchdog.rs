//! [`RuntimeWatchdog`] — async-runtime starvation self-detector + frame-dump trigger.
//!
//! # Concern (and ONLY this concern)
//!
//! Detect that THIS node's single `current_thread` tokio runtime has stopped
//! making progress (wedged or busy-spinning) and, when it has, fire the
//! Python-side frame dump so the next occurrence NAMES the wedged loop.
//! Detection + dump-trigger only. NO failover coupling, NO process exit, NO
//! liveness/election knowledge — those are owned elsewhere (the failover half
//! is a separate, owner-adjudicated design).
//!
//! # Why a separate component (not folded into the liveness beacon)
//!
//! The [`crate::liveness::LivenessBeacon`] is a PURE UDP emitter whose
//! boundary doc states it "knows NOTHING about elections, the mesh, or
//! operational state." Bolting staleness-detection + a SIGUSR1 dump onto its
//! loop would conflate two concerns. This watchdog instead OWNS its own
//! independent OS thread — borrowing the beacon's *survival* property (a
//! mostly-sleeping thread firing a few syscalls is promptly scheduled by CFS
//! even on a fully-pegged core, so it runs even while the runtime it watches
//! is frozen) without sharing the beacon's code or concern.
//!
//! # Mechanism
//!
//! Two halves share one [`AtomicU64`] unix-millis heartbeat:
//!
//! - **Heartbeat (on the runtime under watch):** a `LocalSet` task that
//!   writes `now_millis()` into the shared cell every [`HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL`].
//!   If the runtime is wedged/spinning, this task cannot run, so the cell
//!   stops advancing.
//! - **Checker (off the runtime, dedicated OS thread):** wakes every
//!   [`CHECK_INTERVAL`], reads the cell, and applies the pure
//!   [`starvation_action`] decision. When the heartbeat is older than
//!   [`STARVATION_THRESHOLD`] it logs an unmistakable ERROR and raises
//!   `SIGUSR1` against this process (`libc::raise`) so the Python-side
//!   `faulthandler` (registered in the secondary bootstrap) dumps every
//!   thread's stack AUTOMATICALLY — no operator needed. The dump is
//!   rate-limited to once per [`DUMP_COOLDOWN`] so a sustained freeze emits
//!   one dump per minute, not a flood.
//!
//! # Boundary
//!
//! Input surface: nothing but a `spawn()` call at secondary boot. Output: a
//! log line + a self-directed signal. The caller drives the heartbeat by
//! `spawn_local`-ing the returned future onto its `LocalSet`; the checker
//! thread is owned by the returned handle and joined on drop.
