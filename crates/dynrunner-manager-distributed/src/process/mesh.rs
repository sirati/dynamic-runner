//! [`Mesh`] — route a `(target, frame)` to a local role-slot (loopback)
//! or a remote connection, by id.
//!
//! # Concern
//!
//! The `Mesh` is the role-demux layer that sits ON TOP of a role-agnostic
//! [`PeerTransport`]. It owns the by-value transport plus a registry of
//! the (up to three) local [`RoleSlot`]s as `Weak`s. Its whole job is:
//! given an origin role and a directed [`Destination`] (or a broadcast),
//! decide whether the frame is delivered to a LOCAL slot (loopback) or
//! sent to a REMOTE connection by id — and fan a broadcast to both sides
//! minus the originating role.
//!
//! # What it reuses (does NOT re-derive)
//!
//! Membership, loopback, and broadcast already exist correctly in the
//! transport (the `register_primary_link` by-id fold + the
//! `inprocess_secondary_mesh` model — clarification RV-2). The `Mesh`
//! ADDS ONLY the role-slot demux: remote sends/broadcasts go straight
//! through the transport's `send_to_peer` / `broadcast`; the new code is
//! purely "which local slot does a directed/`All` frame also reach".
//!
//! # Boundary (SUPREME-LAW #5)
//!
//! The transport stays role-agnostic (by `PeerId` only); ALL role
//! knowledge lives here in `manager-distributed`. A caller hands a
//! [`LocalRole`] origin + a [`Destination`] target; it never touches the
//! transport or the slots. The role slots are held as `Weak` so a
//! dropped role's `Arc` (the [`super::Process`]'s) lets the slot
//! auto-die — `deliver_local` self-prunes a stale `Weak` (clarification
//! BUG-2).
