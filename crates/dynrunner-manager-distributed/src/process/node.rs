//! [`Node`] — the OS-process role composition shell.
//!
//! # Concern
//!
//! One OS process hosts the runner's role composition for a single peer:
//! at most one primary + one secondary + one observer coordinator, the
//! hosted mesh ([`MeshHost`] — the running pump that demuxes the wire to
//! them, on whichever executor the composition site picked), and the
//! lifecycle channels that drive promotion (a secondary becoming primary)
//! and demotion (an old primary winding down). `Node` OWNS all of that and
//! is the single teardown lever: dropping a role's [`RoleEntry`] drops its
//! `Arc<RoleSlot>`, so the mesh `Weak` stops upgrading and the slot
//! auto-dies (clarification H4).
//!
//! It is named `Node` (not `Process`) to avoid colliding with
//! [`std::process`] (maint-M2); the file stays `process/node.rs` under the
//! `process/` module.
//!
//! # Scope of THIS file (foundation only)
//!
//! This is the SKELETON: the struct shape, [`RoleEntry`], the typed
//! [`PromotionSignal`], and the promotion channel plumbing (the
//! `promotion_tx` handed out, its receiver held). The demote channel is
//! NOT a node-owned leg — the real BUG-6 demote pairs the role-change
//! hook's sender with the primary coordinator's own `demote_rx` at the
//! composition / promotion-build site. It deliberately does NOT define
//! `Node::run`, does NOT compose or spawn the coordinators, and does NOT
//! build a primary on a promotion signal — those are the later
//! coordinator-rewire + node-wiring waves, which fill the `#[allow(
//! dead_code)] // TODO(C-NODE)` parts once the coordinators drop their
//! transport generic and take a [`MeshClient`] + [`RoleInbox`].
//!
//! # Boundary
//!
//! `Node` holds the [`MeshHost`] (the already-running pump over the
//! by-value transport — the node never sees either) and names the
//! coordinator types by GENERIC parameter — it never reaches into a
//! coordinator's internals nor the transport's. A role "exists" iff its
//! `Option<RoleEntry<_>>` is `Some` (clarification H3: one nullable per
//! role, not a quad of parallel `Option`s).
