//! Incremental tally of the per-outcome terminal partition (#…) — the
//! O(1)-read maintained twin of the O(ledger) [`super::accessors`]
//! `outcome_counts()` double-walk.
//!
//! # Single concern
//!
//! "Keep a running [`OutcomeSummary`] of the LOGICAL terminal ledger so
//! [`ClusterState::outcome_counts`](super::ClusterState::outcome_counts)
//! reads in O(1), not O(ledger)." Nothing else: this module holds the SINGLE
//! state→bucket classification (so the maintained tally and the `#[cfg(test)]`
//! full-walk oracle cannot drift) and the running [`OutcomeSummary`] the
//! classification folds into.
//!
//! # Why incremental, not a per-call walk
//!
//! `outcome_counts()` is called once per worker-task completion (the
//! primary's per-completion log line, plus the secondary / observer /
//! narrator readers). Each call walked the ENTIRE fat `tasks` map AND the
//! settled index to re-partition every terminal — O(ledger). At the 46k-
//! affine scale that is 46k completions × O(46k) = O(N²), the build-phase
//! wall whose iter-rate decays with N and freezes. So the partition is
//! maintained INCREMENTALLY: each task-state mutation DECREMENTS the old
//! state's bucket (if terminal) and INCREMENTS the new state's bucket (if
//! terminal), and the read is a cheap struct copy.
//!
//! # The classification — ONE source of truth
//!
//! [`outcome_bucket_of`] maps a live [`TaskState`] to its
//! [`OutcomeBucket`], or `None` for a NON-terminal state (Pending / InFlight
//! / QueuedAfterLocalDependency / Blocked — uncounted). It is the SOLE
//! mapping: the incremental tally folds through it at the write seam, and the
//! `#[cfg(test)]` oracle ([`ClusterState::outcome_counts_by_scan`](super::ClusterState::outcome_counts_by_scan))
//! folds through it (plus [`settled_bucket_of`] for the settled half) so the
//! two CANNOT drift. The `Failed { kind }` kind→bucket split routes through
//! the one shared [`bucket_for_failed_kind`], the same split
//! `accessors::fold_failed_kind` uses.
//!
//! # Logical-ledger scope (fat ∪ settled) — spill invariance
//!
//! The tally tracks the LOGICAL terminal ledger (fat in-memory `tasks` ∪
//! spilled `settled`), the same universe `outcome_counts()` partitioned. A
//! terminal task is counted ONCE, at the [`set_task_state`](super::ClusterState::set_task_state)
//! transition that made it terminal. Spilling (fat→settled, `commit_spill`)
//! and rehydrating (settled→fat, `unsettle_if_dominated`) move the fat body
//! WITHOUT routing through `set_task_state` — they touch `self.tasks`
//! directly — so the tally is NOT touched on a spill, and the already-counted
//! terminal STAYS counted while settled (its outcome class is unchanged by
//! the move). The tally is therefore spill-NEUTRAL by construction, exactly
//! as the spill is `tasks_hash`-neutral (the term moves between halves) and
//! the `range_fold_memo` / `blocked_by` indices are spill-neutral. A
//! subsequent dominating merge that REHYDRATES then routes the change through
//! `set_task_state`, which reads the now-fat old state and swaps buckets
//! correctly.
