//!
//! - The `RoleChangeHookRegistrar` impl, which lets a transport
//!   register its write-through `RoleTable` cache against the
//!   authoritative ledger.
//! - `apply_locally_for_broadcast` + its `AppliedBatch` output,
//!   the canonical place where the two originator paths (live
//!   primary, promoted secondary) apply a mutation batch locally
//!   and filter to the `Applied` subset so the wire doesn't
//!   amplify under peer-forward redundancy.
