"""Scenario protocol — what every scenario must look like to the driver.

Single concern: the boundary between the orchestration driver
(:mod:`tests.e2e.run_e2e`) and an individual scenario.

The driver knows a scenario through three operations:

1. :meth:`Scenario.prepare` — stage source/output/publish dirs and
   declare the dispatch argv. Returns a :class:`ScenarioPlan`.
2. :meth:`Scenario.run_hook` — optional pre/post-dispatch action
   (e.g. kill-mid-write, scancel a worker). Default is a no-op.
3. :meth:`Scenario.assert_outputs` — verify what landed under the
   publish destination matches the scenario's expectations.

Notes on what is NOT in this API
--------------------------------

- The driver owns cluster lifecycle, heartbeat, timeout. Scenarios
  must never touch the cluster directly.
- The driver passes a :class:`DispatchEnv` so every scenario sees the
  same configured ssh port, slurm root folder, instance id, etc.
  Per-scenario customization happens through :class:`ScenarioPlan`,
  not through the env.
- Scenario "extras" (post-run ssh checks, sacct queries) are
  expressed as :meth:`Scenario.assert_outputs` — that method gets the
  plan back so it can re-derive the publish dir and any ssh hostnames.
